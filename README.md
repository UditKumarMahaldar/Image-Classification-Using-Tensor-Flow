# Image-Classification-Using-Tensor-Flow
About Image Classification is a Machine Learning module that trains itself from an existing dataset of multiclass images and develops a model for future prediction of similar images not encountered during training. Developed using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).This repository contains implementation for multiclass image classification.
